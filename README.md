### 1. Course Overview and Goals

The primary goal of this course was to develop a deep understanding of data analysis and the tools used by data analysts to extract, process, and visualize data. Over the three-month period, I was introduced to various data analysis techniques, which equipped me with essential skills to:

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Manage and query data effectively using SQL.

Design dashboards and visualizations that communicate insights clearly and effectively.

Solve real-world data analysis problems that are valuable for business decision-making.


### 2. Course Duration

Duration: 3 Months
Class Frequency: 3 times per week
Class Hours: 2 hours per session


### 3. Tools Used

The tools learned and applied in this course are essential for data analysts in industry:

1. Microsoft Excel [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.microsoft.com).
  - For data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and basic visualizations.


2. SQL Server SSMS [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads?msockid=0bc67129e9ea6da0170a6561e8b66c4d).
 - For data management, querying, and database operations.


3. Power BI [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntxr16hnw1t?launch=true&mode=full&hl=en-us&gl=ng&ocid=bingwebsearch).
 - For creating professional dashboards and data visualizations to support decision-making.
 


### 4. Learning Outcomes and Skills

The project emphasizes the following skills:

1. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Proficiency in data wrangling and transforming raw data for analysis.
2. Data Querying: Skilled in writing SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and manipulate data for various purposes.
3. Data Visualization: Ability to create informative, interactive visualizations and dashboards in Power BI.
4. Analytical Thinking: Applying logical approaches to solve data-related challenges and interpret trends.


### 5. Tests and Assignments

Each course segment concluded with practical assessments hosted on our LMS (Canvas) to test comprehension and application skills. Here’s a summary:

A. Excel Module:
 Test: Focused on data wrangling, pivot tables, conditional formatting, and creating basic charts.
 Assignments: Involved cleaning datasets, using formulas, and performing basic statistical analysis.


B. SQL Module:
 Test: Examined querying skills, including joins, aggregations, and subqueries.
 Assignments: Involved working with a relational database to extract meaningful information from structured datasets.


C. Power BI Module:
 Test: Assessed the ability to create dashboards and interpret data visualizations.
 Assignments: Required building a dashboard with multiple charts and providing insights based on visualization.

### 6. Detailed Analysis
This section includes a step-by-step breakdown of the data analysis workflow followed during the course, complete with examples and visuals.
- Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Sources: Outline the types of data used (e.g., sample business datasets, customer data, etc.).

Data Import and Storage: Show how data was imported using Excel and SQL Server SSMS. Discuss methods for handling different data types and formats.


- Data Cleaning and Transformation
Steps Taken: Document the data cleaning process—e.g., removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting inconsistencies.

Tools: Use screenshots or code snippets to demonstrate the cleaning and transformation steps in Excel and SQL.


- Data Visualization and Insights
Power BI Dashboards: Include screenshots and descriptions of each visualization (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, heat maps).

Insights Generated: Present findings with explanations, such as key trends, patterns, or anomalies. Example: "Sales increased by 15% quarter-over-quarter, with a marked spike in Q2 due to promotional campaigns."
